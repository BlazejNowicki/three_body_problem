# Three body problem simulation
Classic implementation of the three body problem.
Program simulates three bodies interacting with gravitational forces on a 2d plane. 

Properties of each object  mass, initial position and velocity can be set with the form below the screen. Simulation parameters such as G constant and delay between frames can be adjusted as well.

Positions are calculated by numerically solving differential equation. Step parameter determines precision of calculations.
